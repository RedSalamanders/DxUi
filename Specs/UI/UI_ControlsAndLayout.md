# Controls and layout

Status: normative intended contract
Last reviewed: 2026-09-08

Implemented capabilities are listed in [capabilities.json](../../capabilities.json); requirements for pending
targets are acceptance contracts, not claims of current support.

Controls retain state independently of GPU resources. Buttons, toggles, sliders, selectors and text fields are shared
implementations, not application-local clones. An active gesture has a defined preview, commit and cancel lifecycle.
External state acknowledgement is separate from local intent. Hidden controls leave focus and accessibility trees.

Layout accepts explicit bounds/DPI, reports usable minimums and prepares coherent visuals/hit rectangles together.
Do not reduce a touch target below the consumer's minimum to hide an overflow. Labels and state values may not clip
or overlap. Optional content is removed before required controls. Geometry is recomputed on relevant changes only.
Consumers own density tiers and responsive policy; DxUi contains no AV profile or XENEON dimension rules.

DxUi owns the implemented controls in `src/Controls` and their standalone tests in `Tests/Controls`.
Source is edited in place here; historical import records do not freeze it. Consumer-specific bridges remain
separate work as recorded in capabilities.json.

### Public catalog and gallery

The public API exposes Panel, PageHost, CardPanel, Label, Button, Toggle, Checkbox, RadioButton, RadioButtons,
ProgressBar, PageIndicator, ThroughputGraph, Slider, Toolbar, MenuBar, TabControl, ColorSwatch, TextField, ComboBox, TagPicker,
StatusStrip, PopupLayer, StackPanel, ScrollPanel, TooltipLayer, Tree and Grid. GetControlCatalog returns immutable
descriptors; CreateControl constructs the selected kind and returns E_INVALIDARG for unknown kinds, leaving the
existing result intact on failure. Controls with models are configured by the caller; the factory does not invent
application data. Constructors and examples are ordinary code, with no source-code generator or second control copy.

Adding a control requires an aligned public declaration/implementation, catalog entry/factory case, meaningful
behavior tests and a populated gallery tile. `gallery.ps1` generates light, dark, rainbow light/dark and high-contrast
PNG sheets with interactive-state variants, plus a supplied-device toggle/slider image. Gallery rendering supplements
runtime tests; empty-control construction alone does not prove selection, keyboard, editing or accessibility behavior.

### Page indicator

`PageIndicator` is a non-scrolling position strip. `SetPageCount` accepts 0 through 16. Fewer than two pages paint
nothing, report empty hit bounds, and ignore pointer and keyboard input. `SetSelectedIndex` clamps and does not invoke
`SetOnSelected`. A click on a dot, Left/Right, Home and End change the selected index and notify once. The control
does not wrap. Idle dots use subdued text; the selected dot uses the theme accent. Preferred strip height is
`PageIndicator::kStripHeightDip` (20 DIP). Consumers that draw a matching strip without hosting the control MUST use
the same DIP radius, selected radius and gap constants.

### Slider

Painted chrome and pointer geometry are independent. The gray chrome disc is ink only. Hit testing may be larger than any
painted disc so a fat finger can grab the thumb. Neither layer is sized from the other.

```
  cross-axis (horizontal slider, DIP)

  48  ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─  hit band (unpainted)
  20  ████████ chrome disc (fixed) ████████
  16                                           hovered inner thumb
  12                                           pressed inner thumb
   6  ══════════════════════════════════════    track and rest inner thumb
   0
```

| Layer | Rest | Hover | Pressed | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Track | 6 DIP capsule | — | — | Paint. Fill and remainder share that thickness with no extra stroke. Inset 12 DIP from each end. |
| Inner thumb | 6 DIP | 16 DIP | 12 DIP | Paint. Accent fill matching the track. Rest equals the track so the chrome reads as a gray ring; hover grows the inner until a thin chrome rim remains. |
| Chrome disc | 20 DIP | 20 DIP | 20 DIP | Paint. Opaque gray disc under the inner thumb. It does not scale with hover or press and is not the hit target. |
| Hit band | 48 DIP | 48 DIP | 48 DIP | Pointer only. Centered on the track. Clipped to control bounds when the control is shorter. Not painted. |
| Thumb grab | 24 DIP radius from thumb center | same | same | Pointer only. Half the hit band. A contact in this circle drags from the current value; a contact on the track outside it seeks. |

Keyboard and `RequestValue` ease the painted inner thumb to the new value; pointer drags and `SetValue` snap.
Reduced motion snaps every visual. Keyboard steps still use `SetStep` / `SetLargeStep`. Consumers that need a
fat-finger target size the control to at least the 48 DIP hit band; they do not enlarge the chrome disc to match.

Each control also requires accurate usage documentation in `docs/controls.md`. Code changes review affected docs
and regenerate changed visuals into `docs/gallery` under [the documentation contract](../Core/Core_Documentation.md).

### Consumer-selected popup row minimum

ComboBox exposes `SetMinimumPopupItemHeight` / `GetMinimumPopupItemHeight` for an optional per-instance DIP minimum.
Zero preserves the theme default. Non-finite, negative or greater-than-4096 inputs leave the prior setting unchanged.
The effective height is the greater of the theme row height and the minimum, consistently used for layout, painting,
hit testing, wheel/scroll geometry and keyboard visibility. Changing an open popup invalidates layout and hover,
ends thumb dragging and keeps the selected item visible. No change event or selection is generated by changing density.
Consumers provide sufficient viewport space or a larger selector view; DxUi never shrinks rows to conceal overflow.

### High-contrast primary buttons

Primary buttons preserve the opaque selection-fill/selection-text color pair in high contrast across idle, hover,
pressed and focused states. Decorative blends, animation strength and heuristic text-color substitution must not
dilute that pair. Disabled primary buttons use the button surface and disabled text, retain an opaque border and
hide focus. Enabled focus remains visible for pointer and keyboard and uses the undiluted palette focus color.
The normal light/dark appearance keeps its existing visual treatment.

### Localized built-in text

Consumers supply owned per-instance strings through `ComboBox::SetNoMatchesText`,
`Tree::SetEmptyStateText`, and the existing `Grid::SetEmptyStateText`. Empty overrides restore
English defaults (No matches / No data). ComboBox remeasures an open empty-result popup when
its string changes; Tree/Grid invalidate their empty view. String updates do not alter selection,
query text, focus or callbacks. DxUi does not load consumer numeric resource IDs or cache a
process-global language. Each product/module provides its current translated strings.
