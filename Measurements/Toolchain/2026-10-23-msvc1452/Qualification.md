# DxUi local qualification

Updated 2026-10-24. Local native qualification passed within the agreed scope: x64 Debug/Release/ASan execution and ARM64 Debug/Release/ASan cross-builds.

The final progress-pause and selection-repair source passed all six builds and all 23 native suites in each x64 configuration: 19 ordinary and four explicitly authorized interactive suites. Interactive foreground, keyboard-focus and pointer restoration passed. Final repair-impact measurements and plan/report closeout are pending.

The exact build/run/check receipts are indexed in [LocalValidation.v3.json](LocalValidation.v3.json). Historical optimizer-only status is retained in [Qualification.Phase1.md](Qualification.Phase1.md); its old failures and unchanged-native-source statements describe that phase only. Passing final runs do not erase the original failed or refused attempts.

Release explicitly enables /Gy /GL /OPT:REF and full /LTCG using MSVC 14.52.37025. The original same-path optimizer-only study retains its complete settings, binary sizes and 12-block counterbalanced runtime/resource results. Its reviewed double-holm-v2 analysis establishes no reliable runtime speedup, regression or non-regression guarantee; do not convert noisy or nonsignificant measurements into a pass claim. New repaired-source measurements are a separate artifact comparison.

Native ARM64 execution and actual hosted CI provisioning are separate handoff gates outside the user's local task scope. Existing feature/performance holds remain governed by their owners. No remote publication or merge was performed. The consolidated report is retained at E:/DxUi.Perf/reports/Msvc1452ReleaseOptimization_2026-10-23/CrossRepository.md.
